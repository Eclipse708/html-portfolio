<h1>The best haiku(s) according to Asfandyar</h1>
<h2>Haiku(s) that I think are awesome</h2>
<hr />

<h2>Ouchi Yoshitaka</h2>
<p>Both the victor<br />
    and the vanquished are<br />
    but drops of dew,<br />
    but bolts of lightning<br />
    Thus should we view the world.</p>

<h2>Asano Naganori</h2>
<p>More than cherry blossoms,<br />
    inviting a wind to take them away.<br />
    I wonder what to do<br />
    with the rest of spring.</p><br />

<h2>Kakinomoto-no-Hitomaro</h2>
<p>Not knowing<br />
    that my body lies<br />
    on Mount Kamoâ€™s rocks,<br />
    my love<br />
    awaits me.</p>
